# Machine Learning-Based Financial Assistant

**Project Description:**  
This project is a machine learning-powered financial assistant that analyzes credit card spending and account transactions to provide personalized insights. Since real data was not available, I generated the entire dataset, simulating user transactions, spending habits, and account balances.  

The system predicts future spending, offers personalized budgeting suggestions, and presents visual reports to help users understand their financial behavior and make informed decisions.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Streamlit (for application interface)
